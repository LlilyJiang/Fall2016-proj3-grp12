# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

+ Folder image_test contains 2000 test images we crawled for testing purpose.
+ Folder Caffe_after_PCA contains the data sets which include the features we extracted from the 2000 images given and the 2000 images we crawled.
